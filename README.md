# reIntroNeuralNets
Code used in our Re-Introduction to Neural Networks articles on dimensionless.tech

Started with building a single perceptron for binary out-puts. 

Then we built a more complex net with hiden layers to model non-linear probabilities. 

Finally we evolved the network to enable multi-class Classification

This project was modeled on the articles by [Usman Malik](https://stackabuse.com/creating-a-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-multi-class-classification/)
